# Statistical Foundations to Machine Learning

This repository contains code and notes for the Statistical Foundations to Machine Learning course by Nick Zermeno.

## Course Description

The Statistical Foundations to Machine Learning course covers the fundamentals of statistical theory and methods that form the basis of modern machine learning algorithms. Topics covered include:

- Probability theory and distributions
- Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Linear algebra and matrix calculus
- Optimization algorithms and techniques
- Bayesian statistics
- Supervised and unsupervised learning

The course includes both theoretical concepts and practical applications, with examples and code implementations provided in Python.
